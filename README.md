## Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the AI Nanodegree! In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification and localization, you will make important design decisions about the user experience for your app.  Our goal is that by completing this lab, you understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.  Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.  Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!



## 1. Installation

Download Anaconda

|        | Linux | Mac | Windows | 
|--------|-------|-----|---------|
| 64-bit | [64-bit (bash installer)][lin64] | [64-bit (bash installer)][mac64] | [64-bit (exe installer)][win64]
| 32-bit | [32-bit (bash installer)][lin32] |  | [32-bit (exe installer)][win32]

[win64]: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-Windows-x86_64.exe
[win32]: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-Windows-x86.exe
[mac64]: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
[lin64]: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh
[lin32]: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86.sh

**Install** [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) on your machine. Detailed instructions:

## 2. Create and Activate the Environment

Please go though this [doc](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) before you creating an environment.
After that create a environment using following command

```
conda create --name deep-learning
```

Then activate the environment using following command

```
activate deep-learning
```

#### Git and version control
These instructions also assume you have `git` installed for working with Github from a terminal window, but if you do not, you can download that first with the command:
```
conda install git
```

**Now, you can create a local version of the project**

1. Clone the repository, and navigate to the downloaded folder. This may take a minute or two to clone due to the included image data.
```
git clone https://github.com/shehrum/Dog-Breed-Classifier.git
cd Dog-Breed-Classifier

```

2. Install PyTorch and torchvision; this should install the latest version of PyTorch.
	
	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```
	conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch 
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```
	conda install pytorch -c pytorch
	pip install torchvision
	```

3. Install a few required pip packages, which are specified in the requirements text file (including OpenCV).
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. That's it!, Now run the project using following command, check you default browser and open dlnd_face_generation.ipynb file

```
jupyter notebook
```
